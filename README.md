# fraud_detection

This is a project my friend and I did as a part of our Masters coursework for our Data Mining course. 

We were tasked with finding an interesting dataset and analyzing the dataset using data mining techniques. 

We decided to use a dataset of bank transactions, with some transactions being fradulent. 

Our goal was to create a machine learning model that could detect when a bank transaction was fradulent.

The poster is our project report, please take a look for an in depth explanation of our project.
